### This Week
1. **Fix vulnerabilities**:
   ```bash
   npm audit fix
   npm update
   ```

2. **Enable additional GitHub features**:
   - Dependabot security updates
   - Code scanning
   - Secret scanning alerts

3. **Move Lovable working directory**:
   ```bash
   cp -R ~/Projects/wfd-sunrise-path ~/Projects/active/wfd-sunrise-path-lovable
   # Then update Lovable to use new location
   ```

### Ongoing
- Review CODEOWNERS monthly
- Update PRIVACY.md with any new data types
- Run security audits quarterly
- Keep dependencies updated
