#### üö® CRITICAL: Average Length of Stay Test

This is the **most important test** because it verifies the bug fix (line 111) is deployed:

```typescript
// Line 111 in calculations.ts MUST be:
.filter((r) => r.ExitDate) // Excludes active enrollments

// If this fix is NOT deployed, you'll see:
‚ùå 274,271 days (WRONG - includes active clients)

// If fix IS deployed, you'll see:
‚úÖ 115-170 days (CORRECT - excludes active clients)
```

**Test Steps:**

---

## Phase 3: Data Accuracy Deep Dive (10 minutes)

### 3.1 Manual Calculation Verification

**Test File:** `~/WFD_Test_Upload_Clean.csv`

#### Count Total Clients
```bash
# Manual verification
cat ~/WFD_Test_Upload_Clean.csv | tail -n +2 | cut -d',' -f1 | sort -u | wc -l
# Expected: 8 unique ClientIDs
```
- [ ] Dashboard shows same count

#### Count Active Enrollments
```bash
# Clients with blank ExitDate
cat ~/WFD_Test_Upload_Clean.csv | tail -n +2 | awk -F',' '$4 == "" {count++} END {print count}'
# Expected: 2-3 clients
```
- [ ] Dashboard shows same count

#### Count Housing Placements
```bash
# Clients with "Permanent Housing" in ExitDestination
grep -i "Permanent Housing" ~/WFD_Test_Upload_Clean.csv | wc -l
# Expected: 3-5 placements
```
- [ ] Dashboard shows same count

#### Calculate Average LOS (Manual)
**For exited clients only:**
1. [ ] Open CSV in Excel/Numbers
2. [ ] Filter to rows with ExitDate (not blank)
3. [ ] Calculate days between IntakeDate and ExitDate for each
4. [ ] Average those values
5. [ ] Should be ~115-170 days
6. [ ] Compare to dashboard metric

**Critical:** If dashboard shows 274,271 days, calculation is including active clients (bug not fixed).

### 3.2 Housing Placement Rate Calculation

Formula: `(Housing Placements / Total Exits) √ó 100`

**Manual Calculation:**
1. [ ] Count clients with ExitDate AND "Permanent Housing"
2. [ ] Count total clients with ExitDate (exited)
3. [ ] Divide: placements √∑ exits
4. [ ] Multiply by 100 for percentage
5. [ ] Compare to dashboard

**Example:**
- 4 placements out of 6 exits = 66.7%
- Dashboard should show ~67%

### 3.3 Data Quality Coverage Calculation

Formula: `(Non-null records / Total records) √ó 100`

**For IntakeDate:**
1. [ ] Count rows with IntakeDate value
2. [ ] Count total rows (8 clients)
3. [ ] Divide and multiply by 100
4. [ ] Compare to Quality page

**Example:**
- 8 out of 8 have IntakeDate = 100% coverage ‚úÖ
- 6 out of 8 have IntakeDate = 75% coverage ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Verify:**
- [ ] All field coverage % match manual counts
- [ ] Critical fields (IntakeDate, ExitDestination) flagged correctly
