# ‚úÖ WFD Compliance Project Alignment Complete

## Date: August 10, 2025

---

## üéØ **Successful Alignment Achieved**

### **What We've Accomplished:**

1. **Unified Source of Truth**
   - Lovable project code successfully synced to Recovery-Compass repository
   - GitHub: https://github.com/Recovery-Compass/wfd-sunrise-path
   - All future Lovable work can be synced using the `sync-from-lovable.sh` script

2. **Clean Deployment Path**
   ```
   Lovable.app ‚Üí Local Sync ‚Üí GitHub (Recovery-Compass) ‚Üí AWS Amplify ‚Üí wfd-compliance.org
   ```

3. **Context Synchronization**
   - AI context updated in Context Hub
   - All AI tools now aware of WFD Compliance project structure
   - MCP servers can access project context

## üìÇ **Current Project Structure**

| Component | Location | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Lovable Source** | `/Users/ericjones/Projects/wfd-sunrise-path` (symlink) | Original Lovable development |
| **Active Development** | `/Users/ericjones/Projects/active/wfd-sunrise-path` | Clean local copy for deployment |
| **GitHub** | `Recovery-Compass/wfd-sunrise-path` | Version control & CI/CD trigger |
| **Live Preview** | `wfd-sunrise-path.lovable.app` | Lovable preview environment |
| **Production** | `wfd-compliance.org` | AWS Amplify deployment (pending) |

---

## üîÑ **Ongoing Sync Workflow**

### When Lovable Updates:
```bash
# 1. Navigate to active directory
cd ~/Projects/active/wfd-sunrise-path

# 2. Run sync script
./sync-from-lovable.sh

# 3. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Sync from Lovable: [describe changes]"
git push origin main

# 4. AWS Amplify auto-deploys to wfd-compliance.org
```

### Quick Commands:
```bash
# Go to project
rc-go wfd-sunrise-path

# Update context
rc-context-update

# Check status
git status
```

## ‚ö° **Next Steps for Full Deployment**

### 1. AWS Amplify Setup (Required)
- [ ] Go to [AWS Amplify Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/)
- [ ] Create new app ‚Üí Host web app
- [ ] Connect to `Recovery-Compass/wfd-sunrise-path`
- [ ] Configure build settings (amplify.yml already in place)
- [ ] Get Amplify domain (e.g., d123456.amplifyapp.com)

### 2. Cloudflare DNS Update (Required)
- [ ] Log into [Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
- [ ] Select `wfd-compliance.org`
- [ ] Add CNAME records:
  - @ ‚Üí [amplify-domain].amplifyapp.com (Proxied)
  - www ‚Üí [amplify-domain].amplifyapp.com (Proxied)

### 3. Verify Deployment
- [ ] Check https://wfd-compliance.org loads
- [ ] Verify Recovery Compass branding appears
- [ ] Test functionality

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Details**

### What's Included:
- React/TypeScript application
- Supabase integration ready
- Tailwind CSS styling
- Recovery Compass branding
- FastAPI backend (in `/app` directory)
- Documentation and compliance tracking features

### What's Excluded (via .gitignore):
- node_modules (will be installed during build)
- Environment variables
- Build artifacts
- Temporary files
- Secrets and credentials

---

## üîê **Security Notes**

- Previous push attempts were blocked due to secrets in git history
- Current approach uses clean sync without problematic files
- All secrets should be added via AWS Amplify environment variables
- Never commit .env files

---

## üìä **Monitoring & Maintenance**

### Daily:
- Check AWS Amplify build logs
- Monitor Cloudflare analytics
- Review error reports

### Weekly:
- Sync from Lovable if updates made
- Update context for AI tools
- Review and clear caches if needed

### Monthly:
- Archive old deployments
- Update dependencies
- Security audit

---

## üéâ **Success Criteria Met**

‚úÖ Lovable and Recovery-Compass repos aligned
‚úÖ Clean deployment path established
‚úÖ Context synchronization active
‚úÖ No secrets in repository
‚úÖ Ready for AWS Amplify connection
‚úÖ Cloudflare configuration documented
‚úÖ Recovery Compass principles maintained

---

## üÜò **If Issues Arise**

1. **Sync Issues**: Re-run `./sync-from-lovable.sh`
2. **Build Failures**: Check AWS Amplify logs
3. **DNS Problems**: Verify Cloudflare settings
4. **Context Drift**: Run `rc-context-update`
5. **Git Conflicts**: Use local version as source of truth

---

## üìù **Notes**

- Google Drive sync issues prevented direct push from Lovable folder
- Using rsync with exclusions ensures clean code transfer
- The sync script can be customized as needed
- Consider moving away from Google Drive for development due to timeout issues
