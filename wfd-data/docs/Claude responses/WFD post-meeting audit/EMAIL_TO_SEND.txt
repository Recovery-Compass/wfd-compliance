üîç KEY FINDINGS

Housing Tracker (First_Day_UHA_Housing_Match.xlsx):
- ‚úÖ 27 client records processed from April sheet
- ‚ùå CRITICAL GAP: IntakeDate missing (cannot compute Length of Stay without this)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 96% of Exit Dates are null (26/27 blank)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 37% missing HMIS IDs (10/27 blank)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "UHA Date" semantics unclear (application sent vs. actual move-in?)

Program Data Sheet (Master_Data_Spreadsheet.xlsx):
- ‚úÖ Aggregated metrics suitable for Activity Dashboard
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Field names inconsistent (casing/punctuation varies)
- ‚úÖ No schema violations for its intended purpose (program-level summaries)

MOU Compliance Status: üü° 60% ‚Äî Architecture complete; execution pending WFD data population

üö® IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED (This Week)

1. FOLDER ACCESS (Randall)
   - Share the canonical OneDrive folder path (the direct-link that worked in our 10/2 meeting)
   - I'll verify sync parity and confirm "Step 1 Complete"

2. OCTOBER HOUSING TRACKER (Jacob)
   - Populate the MOU template (Housing_Tracker_2025-10_MOU_Template.xlsx) with October data
   - Include ALL MOU-required fields: ClientID, ProgramName, IntakeDate, ExitDate, ExitDestination, HousingPlacementDate, LoS
   - Backfill IntakeDate for existing clients (critical for LoS calculation)

3. CLARIFY UHA DATE DEFINITION (Both)
   - Does "UHA Date" = actual move-in date, or application submission date?
   - This affects how we map HousingPlacementDate for MOU compliance

Once I receive:
- Folder access confirmation
- October Housing Tracker with complete MOU fields
- UHA Date clarification

...I'll begin Phase 2 (Outcomes Dashboard) immediately and target a live preview for the Oct 14 management meeting.

üìä PHASE 2 PREVIEW (Post-Step 1)

Outcomes Dashboard:
- Housing placement rate (% with HousingPlacementDate)
- Average Length of Stay by exit destination
- Exit destinations pie chart (Permanent Housing, Program Transfer, etc.)
- Time to housing histogram
- Active vs. exited clients trend

Activity Dashboard:
- Service delivery cards (clients served, meals, services, transportation)
- Services by site (grouped bar chart)
- Demographics (age, gender, race/ethnicity breakdowns)
- Month-over-month trends
- Site comparison table

Tech stack: Lovable.dev (React + Recharts) with WFD brand palette
Timeline: 7-11 days from Step 1 completion

üõ°Ô∏è MOU CHECK

‚úÖ Roles: WFD owns source data; RC architects & processes
‚úÖ IP: ERD model & RC platform = RC; source data = WFD; case study co-owned
‚úÖ Term: Sept 1, 2025 start; six-month term active
‚úÖ Claims posture: Descriptive KPIs only (no historical success claims until validated)

---

NEXT STEPS (Priority Order):

TODAY: Review attachments and confirm receipt
THIS WEEK: Provide folder path + October Housing Tracker + UHA Date clarification
NEXT WEEK: Phase 2 dashboard build begins
OCT 14: Management meeting with live dashboard preview

Appreciate you both. We've got the architecture locked‚Äîonce Step 1 is confirmed, the dashboards will move fast.
