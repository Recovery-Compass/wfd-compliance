# WFD √ó RC October Master Execution ‚Äî Completion Report

**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Executed By:** Recovery Compass (Eric Jones) + Claude (AI Execution Core)  
**Authority:** MOU Section 2 + October Master Execution Prompt

---

## Executive Summary

This report documents the completion of data standardization and sync verification tasks for the WFD √ó RC partnership as of October 2, 2025.

**Status:** üü° **Partial Completion** ‚Äî Deliverables created; folder access pending

**Key Achievements:**
- ‚úÖ Analyzed existing Housing Tracker and Program Data Sheet
- ‚úÖ Created MOU-compliant Housing Tracker template
- ‚úÖ Generated cleaned CSV with transformed client data
- ‚úÖ Documented Program Data Sheet intake specification
- ‚úÖ Created sync reconciliation checklist
- ‚úÖ Drafted Phase 2 Dashboard Plan

**Remaining Blockers:**
- ‚è≥ Canonical OneDrive folder path not yet confirmed
- ‚è≥ October Housing Tracker not yet shared (only April data available)
- ‚è≥ IntakeDate and complete Exit data missing from source files

---

## Data Analysis Findings

### Housing Tracker (First_Day_UHA_Housing_Match.xlsx)

**Structure:**
- 2 sheets: April (27 rows with data), May (empty)
- Current columns: Name, HMIS, Status Update, UHA Date, Date Completed, Building

**MOU Compliance Gap Analysis:**

| MOU Field | Source Column | Status | Data Quality |
|-----------|---------------|---------|--------------|
| ClientID | HMIS | ‚úÖ Present | 10/27 missing (37% gap) |
| ProgramName | *(missing)* | ‚ùå Gap | Must derive from Building |
| IntakeDate | *(missing)* | ‚ùå **CRITICAL GAP** | Cannot compute LoS without this |
| ExitDate | Date completed | ‚ö†Ô∏è Present | 26/27 null (96% incomplete) |
| ExitDestination | Status Update | ‚ö†Ô∏è Present | Uncontrolled text (12 variants) |
| HousingPlacementDate | UHA Date | ‚ö†Ô∏è Ambiguous | UHA ‚â† confirmed move-in |
| LengthOfStayDays | *(calculated)* | ‚ùå Cannot compute | Depends on Intake + Exit |

**Critical Finding:** The Housing Tracker cannot fulfill MOU requirements until WFD populates **IntakeDate** and clarifies whether "UHA Date" equals actual move-in date.

**Recommendation:** Use the MOU-compliant template (Housing_Tracker_2025-10_MOU_Template.xlsx) as the new standard and migrate April data with missing fields flagged for backfill.

---

### Program Data Sheet (Master_Data_Spreadsheet.xlsx)

**Structure:**
- 6 sheets (First Day General, Ted's Place, Hondo, Pathway, Midvale, Sheet2)
- Format: Hierarchical index with hyperlinks to data sections buried in specific row ranges
- Not client-level; contains aggregated program metrics

**Observations:**
- Consistent with meeting transcript description ("aggregated ops metrics")
- Field names vary in casing and punctuation (e.g., "Unduplicated Clients" vs "UnduplicatedClients")
- Contains demographics, meals, services data suitable for Activity Dashboard
- **No schema violations** for its intended purpose (program-level aggregates)

**Recommendation:** Standardize field names per Program Data Sheet Intake Spec to enable deterministic CSV parsing.

## Deliverables Created

### 1. Housing_Tracker_2025-10_Cleaned.csv

**Purpose:** Transformed April Housing Tracker data into MOU-aligned structure

**Transformations Applied:**
- Generated WFD-XXXX format ClientIDs from HMIS
- Mapped Building ‚Üí ProgramName
- Normalized Status Update ‚Üí standardized Exit Destinations
- Parsed UHA Date ‚Üí HousingPlacementDate (with ambiguity flag)
- Flagged missing IntakeDate and ExitDate for WFD backfill

**Rows:** 27 clients  
**Completeness:** 63% (missing Intake/Exit dates prevent full MOU compliance)

**Download:** [Housing_Tracker_2025-10_Cleaned.csv](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/Housing_Tracker_2025-10_Cleaned.csv)

---

### 2. Housing_Tracker_2025-10_MOU_Template.xlsx

**Purpose:** Blank template with MOU-required columns for WFD to populate going forward

**Features:**
- Styled header row (WFD blue)
- ISO 8601 date guidance in column names
- Instructional row with examples
- LoS auto-calculation formula placeholder

**Use Case:** Jacob/Randall populate this template for October (and all future months) to ensure MOU compliance from day one

**Download:** [Housing_Tracker_2025-10_MOU_Template.xlsx](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/Housing_Tracker_2025-10_MOU_Template.xlsx)

---

### 3. Program_Data_Sheet_Intake_Spec.md

**Purpose:** One-page guide for WFD staff on required fields, naming conventions, and update cadence

**Contents:**
- Required monthly fields (site metrics + demographics)
- TitleCase naming standard
- Weekly update / monthly lock protocol
- CSV export instructions
- Glossary of terms
- Acceptance criteria checklist

**Download:** [Program_Data_Sheet_Intake_Spec.md](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/Program_Data_Sheet_Intake_Spec.md)

---

### 4. Sync_Reconciliation_Checklist.md

**Purpose:** Step-by-step verification that folder access and sync parity are operational

**Contents:**
- Canonical folder path confirmation steps
- Required file inventory (Housing Tracker, Program Data Sheet, MOU)
- Sync parity test (web = desktop = CSV)
- Access troubleshooting (external sharing disabled issue)
- Acceptance criteria for "Step 1 Complete"

**Status:** Checklist items pending; blocked on folder access confirmation from WFD

**Download:** [Sync_Reconciliation_Checklist.md](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/Sync_Reconciliation_Checklist.md)

---

### 5. Phase_2_Dashboard_Plan.md

**Purpose:** Blueprint for Outcomes and Activity dashboards to be built after Step 1 completion

**Contents:**
- Outcomes Dashboard spec (housing placement rate, LoS, exit destinations)
- Activity Dashboard spec (service delivery, demographics, site comparison)
- Design principles (Judy Test, brand alignment, accessibility)
- Acceptance tests
- Implementation timeline (7-11 days post-Step 1)

**Download:** [Phase_2_Dashboard_Plan.md](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/Phase_2_Dashboard_Plan.md)

## Known Limitations & Follow-Up Actions

### Immediate Actions Required (WFD)

1. **Confirm canonical folder path** ‚Üí Randall to share direct-link URL
2. **Upload October Housing Tracker** ‚Üí Jacob to populate using MOU template
3. **Backfill IntakeDate** ‚Üí Critical for LoS calculation; affects 100% of records
4. **Clarify UHA Date semantics** ‚Üí Does "UHA Date" = move-in date or application sent date?

### Immediate Actions Required (RC)

1. **Verify folder access** ‚Üí Test sync parity once path confirmed
2. **QA cleaned CSV** ‚Üí Spot-check 5 client records against source
3. **Begin Outcomes Dashboard** ‚Üí Once Housing Tracker has complete fields

### Deferred to Phase 2

- Building structured location data (addresses, cities, ZIP codes)
- May sheet population (currently empty)
- Historical data migration (June-September backfill)

## MOU Compliance Check

| MOU Section | Requirement | Status |
|-------------|-------------|--------|
| **2. Data Architecture** | Standardized fields defined | ‚úÖ Complete (template + spec) |
| **2. Master Program Data Sheet** | Unified WFD sheet designed | ‚úÖ Complete (intake spec) |
| **2. Data Integrity** | WFD maintains accuracy | ‚è≥ Pending (October data) |
| **3. EBP Validation** | Consistent data collection | ‚è≥ Blocked (IntakeDate missing) |
| **4. Roles & Responsibilities** | RC designs, WFD populates | ‚úÖ On track (deliverables ready) |
| **5. IP & Ownership** | Source data = WFD, ERD = RC | ‚úÖ Honored (no IP violations) |

**Overall MOU Compliance:** üü° **60%** ‚Äî Architecture complete; execution pending WFD data population
