# üö® Domain Configuration Fix - Action Required

## Problem Identified ‚úÖ

**Current State:**
- Domain: `compliance.erdmethod.org`
- **Currently Serving:** Recovery Compass (AI-Powered Addiction Recovery Platform)
- **Should Serve:** WFD Compliance Dashboard

**Verification:**
```bash
curl -s https://compliance.erdmethod.org | grep title
# Shows: "Fighting a system that refuses to count your lived experiences..."
# This is Recovery Compass, NOT WFD Compliance Dashboard
```

**Root Cause:** Domain is connected to the wrong Lovable project.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution: Reconnect Domain (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Identify Both Projects

You have **TWO** Lovable projects:

**Project A: Recovery Compass** (Currently connected to domain)
- URL: Unknown (need to find this project)
- Domain: `compliance.erdmethod.org` ‚Üê **WRONG**
- Content: "Recovery Compass - AI-Powered Addiction Recovery Platform"

**Project B: WFD Compliance Dashboard** (Should be connected)
- URL: https://lovable.dev/projects/e0f02acd-69ab-4298-96da-08410edc02a4
- Domain: Should be `compliance.erdmethod.org` ‚Üê **CORRECT**
- Content: "WFD Compliance Dashboard" with Fun Zone
- Git Repo: https://github.com/Recovery-Compass/wfd-compliance

---

### Step 2: Disconnect Domain from Recovery Compass

**Find the Recovery Compass Project:**
1. Go to your Lovable dashboard: https://lovable.dev/dashboard
2. Look through your projects for one titled "Recovery Compass" or similar
3. OR look for project with domain `compliance.erdmethod.org` listed

**Disconnect the Domain:**
1. Open the Recovery Compass project
2. Click **Settings** (gear icon)
3. Go to **Domains** tab
4. Find `compliance.erdmethod.org`
5. Click **Disconnect** or **Remove**
6. Confirm the disconnection

---

### Step 3: Connect Domain to WFD Compliance Dashboard

**Open WFD Project:**
1. Go to: https://lovable.dev/projects/e0f02acd-69ab-4298-96da-08410edc02a4
2. Or use your magic link from earlier

**Connect the Domain:**
1. Click **Settings** (gear icon)
2. Go to **Domains** tab
3. Click **Add Custom Domain** or **Connect Domain**
4. Enter: `compliance.erdmethod.org`
5. Follow any verification steps (may need to add DNS records)
6. Click **Save** or **Connect**

---

### Step 4: Verify DNS Settings (If Needed)

**Check Your DNS Provider (Cloudflare/GoDaddy/etc.):**

The domain should have these records:
```
Type: CNAME or A
Name: compliance
Target: [Lovable's hosting address]
```

**Lovable will provide the correct target** when you add the domain. Common patterns:
- `CNAME` to Lovable's provided URL
- `A` record to specific IP addresses

**If DNS needs updating:**
1. Log into your DNS provider (probably Cloudflare based on headers)
2. Update the `compliance.erdmethod.org` record
3. Point to Lovable's provided address for WFD project
4. Save changes
5. Wait 5-10 minutes for propagation

---

### Step 5: Test the Fix

**After Domain Reconnection:**

```bash
# Wait 5-10 minutes for DNS/CDN cache to clear

# Then test:
curl -s https://compliance.erdmethod.org | grep -i "title\|wfd\|whittier"

# Should show:
# <title>WFD Compliance Dashboard</title>
# OR
# <title>Whittier First Day</title>
```

**Browser Test:**
1. Open https://compliance.erdmethod.org in **incognito/private mode**
2. Should see: "WFD Compliance Dashboard" or "Welcome to WFD Compliance Dashboard"
3. Should see "Upload Data File" section
4. Navigation should include: Dashboard, Clients, Programs, Quality, **Fun Zone ‚ú®**

**If still showing Recovery Compass:**
- Clear browser cache
- Wait another 5-10 minutes
- Try different browser
- Check Cloudflare cache (may need to purge)

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't Find Recovery Compass Project
**Solution:**
1. Go to Lovable dashboard: https://lovable.dev/dashboard
2. Look at **all** your projects
3. Check each one's **Domains** settings
4. Find which has `compliance.erdmethod.org` connected

### Issue: Domain Already in Use Error
**Cause:** Domain still connected to Recovery Compass  
**Solution:** Must disconnect from old project first before connecting to new

### Issue: DNS Verification Failed
**Cause:** DNS records point to old configuration  
**Solution:** 
1. Get correct DNS target from Lovable
2. Update in Cloudflare/DNS provider
3. Wait 10-15 minutes for propagation

### Issue: Still Showing Old Site After 30 Minutes
**Causes:**
1. Cloudflare cache not purged
2. Browser cache
3. DNS not propagated

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Purge Cloudflare cache (if you have access)
~/purge-cloudflare-cache.sh compliance.erdmethod.org

# OR visit Cloudflare dashboard:
# Caching ‚Üí Configuration ‚Üí Purge Everything
```
